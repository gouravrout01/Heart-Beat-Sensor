# Heartbeat Sensor Using 8051 Microcontroller  

## **Project Overview**  
This project involves designing a real-time heartbeat monitoring system using the 8051 microcontroller. The system reads the heartbeat signal via a sensor, processes it, and displays the heart rate in beats per minute (BPM) on a 7-segment LED display.

## **Features**  
- Real-time heart rate measurement.  
- Compact and efficient design.  
- Heart rate displayed on a 7-segment LED for clear visualization.

## **Components Used**  
1. **8051 Microcontroller**: Core controller for processing and logic.  
2. **Heartbeat Sensor**: Captures the heartbeat signal (e.g., IR-based or pulse sensor).  
3. **Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)**: Converts the analog signal into a digital format.  
4. **7-Segment LED Display**: Displays the heart rate in BPM.  
5. **Decoder IC**: Converts digital data into a format suitable for 7-segment LED display.  
6. **Resistors and Capacitors**: For signal conditioning and circuit stability.  
7. **Power Supply**: Provides 5V DC power to the circuit.

## **System Workflow**  
1. **Signal Acquisition**: The heartbeat sensor detects pulses and generates an analog signal.  
2. **Signal Conditioning**: The signal is amplified, filtered, and prepared for ADC conversion.  
3. **ADC Conversion**: The analog signal is converted to a digital signal for processing.  
4. **Microcontroller Processing**:  
   - The 8051 microcontroller calculates BPM based on the input signal.  
   - It sends the result to the 7-segment display for real-time visualization.  
5. **Display Output**: The BPM is shown on the 7-segment LED in real time.
